1. Swap Two Numbers (Without a Third Variable)
Enter number 1 for Swap:
24
Enter number 2 for Swap:
56
Before Swap: A = 24 B= 56
After Swap: A: 56 B: 24

Logic: a = a+b;
       b =a-b;
	   a= a-b;

2.Welcome to code to get Even or Odd number detection
Give input to check the number: 
1345
Odd Number
Logic:
if else logics.
Normal block/ ternerary expressionn

System.out.println((a % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd");

3.Take User Name + Age & Greet Them
Input:
Name: Ayushka  
Age: 26  
Output:
Hi Ayushka! You are 26 years old.

Improvement done: Hi Pigi,Good Afternoon!! You are 26 years old!  --> Now the code will give the time of the day 

New additional learning:
===========================
import java.time.LocalTime; // To get AM/PM variation
LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();
int hour = now.getHour();
String Timegreeting = (hour < 12 ) ? "Good Morning!!" : "Good Afternoon!!";// Instead of if-else block ternary expression block

import java.time.Year; // To count age from birthyear
int currentYear = Year.now().getValue();
int age = currentYear - birthyear;
